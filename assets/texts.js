    phase: {
    foundation: `
The Foundation Phase emphasizes stability, grounding, and the creation of reliable structures.
It often appears when life is asking for consistency rather than speed.

Common signs of this phase include focusing on routines, simplifying priorities,
and rebuilding your sense of “what actually supports me” day to day.
Some people also notice reduced tolerance for chaos, vague plans, or social noise.

This phase is not about shrinking your life.
It is about strengthening your base so future movement is sustainable.
When you treat stability as an asset—not a delay—clarity tends to arrive faster.
    `,

    transition: `
The Transition Phase emerges when existing roles, habits, or directions no longer feel fully aligned.
The next chapter may not be fully visible yet, but the current one feels harder to stay inside.

Common signs include restlessness, questioning, mental “busyness,” or subtle dissatisfaction—
even when nothing is objectively wrong.
Many people experience mixed signals: a desire to change alongside hesitation or doubt.

This phase is not a mistake or failure.
It is a natural response to outgrowing previous structures before the next direction becomes clear.
Rather than demanding immediate answers, this phase responds best to observation, curiosity,
and reduced pressure to decide too quickly.
    `,

    expansion: `
The Expansion Phase reflects outward movement—new ideas, opportunities, experimentation,
and a growing sense of momentum.
Energy in this phase often feels more expressive, future-oriented, and action-ready.

Common signs include taking initiative, trying new environments, sharing your work,
or feeling pulled toward “more”—more learning, more reach, more possibility.
At times, this can come with impatience or the feeling that you should move faster.

Expansion works best when guided by awareness rather than urgency.
When your actions are aligned with a clear reason—not just momentum—progress becomes cleaner,
and you avoid overextending yourself.
    `,

    consolidation: `
The Consolidation Phase focuses on integration, refinement, and strengthening what you have already built.
It often appears after growth, change, or experimentation.

Common signs include prioritizing stability, simplifying systems, improving consistency,
and making small corrections that improve long-term results.
Some people feel this phase is “less exciting,” but it is often where resilience is built.

Consolidation supports sustainability over strain.
When you invest in what already works—rather than chasing constant novelty—your life becomes easier to manage,
and your progress becomes more durable.
    `,

    reflection: `
The Reflection Phase centers on review, meaning-making, and internal alignment.
It often arises when external movement slows and your attention naturally turns inward.

Common signs include reprocessing experiences, questioning assumptions, seeking emotional clarity,
or noticing patterns you previously ignored.
Some people feel “stuck” here, but reflection is often a productive form of progress.

This phase creates insight that can’t be forced through action alone.
When you give yourself permission to understand before you push forward,
your next decisions tend to feel more aligned—and less reactive.

  cycle: {
    beginning: `
The Beginning Cycle represents early movement and emerging awareness.
It is a stage where direction starts to form, but outcomes remain undefined.

This cycle favors curiosity, small steps, and openness over immediate certainty.
    `,

    acceleration: `
The Acceleration Cycle is marked by increasing momentum and engagement.
Actions taken during this cycle tend to build upon one another more quickly.

Attention to pacing becomes important to maintain balance.
    `,

    peak: `
The Peak Cycle reflects intensity, visibility, and heightened impact.
Efforts often reach their most active or demanding point during this stage.

Clarity and responsibility are especially important here.
    `,

    adjustment: `
The Adjustment Cycle emphasizes recalibration and fine-tuning.
It often follows periods of intensity, asking for course correction rather than abandonment.

Small changes during this cycle can significantly affect long-term outcomes.
    `,

    closure: `
The Closure Cycle involves completion, release, and transition away from what has run its course.
It allows space for lessons to integrate before the next beginning.

Closure does not imply loss; it creates capacity.

   opening: {
    default: `
Based on your responses, this reading reflects the broader context of your current life phase,
combined with the specific timing of the cycle you are moving through.

Rather than offering predictions, it focuses on interpretation —
helping you understand why certain patterns, questions, or tensions may be present right now.
    `
  },
  
  integration: {
    default: `
When a life phase and cycle intersect, the experience is shaped by both broader context and immediate timing.
Rather than indicating a fixed outcome, this combination highlights what may be most useful to focus on now.

Clarity often emerges through attention and reflection, not force.
