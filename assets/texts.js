    phase: {
    foundation: `
The Foundation Phase emphasizes stability, grounding, and the creation of reliable structures.
It often appears when life is asking for consistency rather than speed.

Common signs of this phase include focusing on routines, simplifying priorities,
and rebuilding your sense of “what actually supports me” day to day.
Some people also notice reduced tolerance for chaos, vague plans, or social noise.

This phase is not about shrinking your life.
It is about strengthening your base so future movement is sustainable.
When you treat stability as an asset—not a delay—clarity tends to arrive faster.
    `,

    transition: `
The Transition Phase emerges when existing roles, habits, or directions no longer feel fully aligned.
The next chapter may not be fully visible yet, but the current one feels harder to stay inside.

Common signs include restlessness, questioning, mental “busyness,” or subtle dissatisfaction—
even when nothing is objectively wrong.
Many people experience mixed signals: a desire to change alongside hesitation or doubt.

This phase is not a mistake or failure.
It is a natural response to outgrowing previous structures before the next direction becomes clear.
Rather than demanding immediate answers, this phase responds best to observation, curiosity,
and reduced pressure to decide too quickly.
    `,

    expansion: `
The Expansion Phase reflects outward movement—new ideas, opportunities, experimentation,
and a growing sense of momentum.
Energy in this phase often feels more expressive, future-oriented, and action-ready.

Common signs include taking initiative, trying new environments, sharing your work,
or feeling pulled toward “more”—more learning, more reach, more possibility.
At times, this can come with impatience or the feeling that you should move faster.

Expansion works best when guided by awareness rather than urgency.
When your actions are aligned with a clear reason—not just momentum—progress becomes cleaner,
and you avoid overextending yourself.
    `,

    consolidation: `
The Consolidation Phase focuses on integration, refinement, and strengthening what you have already built.
It often appears after growth, change, or experimentation.

Common signs include prioritizing stability, simplifying systems, improving consistency,
and making small corrections that improve long-term results.
Some people feel this phase is “less exciting,” but it is often where resilience is built.

Consolidation supports sustainability over strain.
When you invest in what already works—rather than chasing constant novelty—your life becomes easier to manage,
and your progress becomes more durable.
    `,

    reflection: `
The Reflection Phase centers on review, meaning-making, and internal alignment.
It often arises when external movement slows and your attention naturally turns inward.

Common signs include reprocessing experiences, questioning assumptions, seeking emotional clarity,
or noticing patterns you previously ignored.
Some people feel “stuck” here, but reflection is often a productive form of progress.

This phase creates insight that can’t be forced through action alone.
When you give yourself permission to understand before you push forward,
your next decisions tend to feel more aligned—and less reactive.

  cycle: {
    beginning: `
The Beginning Cycle represents early movement and emerging awareness.
It is the stage where direction starts to form, but outcomes remain undefined.

Common signs include curiosity, tentative planning, and a desire to explore
without fully committing yet.
People in this cycle often feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty,
as possibilities feel open but unproven.

This cycle responds best to experimentation and low-pressure exploration.
Rather than demanding certainty, it supports learning through small,
reversible steps that build confidence over time.
    `,

    acceleration: `
The Acceleration Cycle is marked by increasing momentum and engagement.
Actions taken during this stage tend to compound more quickly,
and progress becomes more visible.

Common signs include heightened activity, faster decision-making,
and the sense that “things are moving now.”
At times, this can create pressure to keep up or push harder.

This cycle benefits from intentional pacing.
When momentum is guided rather than chased,
progress remains sustainable and less stressful.
    `,

    peak: `
The Peak Cycle reflects intensity, visibility, and heightened impact.
Energy, responsibility, and attention often reach their highest levels here.

Common signs include increased demand, recognition, or pressure to perform.
Some people feel energized by this stage, while others feel stretched.

The Peak Cycle asks for clarity and conscious prioritization.
By choosing focus over overextension,
you protect both results and well-being.
    `,

    adjustment: `
The Adjustment Cycle emphasizes recalibration and fine-tuning.
It often follows periods of intensity or growth,
when small misalignments become more noticeable.

Common signs include fatigue, reassessment, or the sense that
minor changes could significantly improve outcomes.
This is not a step backward, but a strategic pause.

Adjustment works best when treated as refinement rather than correction.
Subtle shifts made here often determine long-term stability.
    `,

    closure: `
The Closure Cycle involves completion, release, and transition away
from what has run its course.

Common signs include emotional processing, finalization of projects,
or the need to let go of identities or commitments that no longer fit.
This stage can feel both relieving and bittersweet.

Closure creates capacity.
When endings are acknowledged rather than rushed,
the next beginning tends to arrive with greater clarity.

   opening: {
    default: `
Based on your responses, this reading reflects the broader context of your current life phase,
combined with the specific timing of the cycle you are moving through.

Rather than offering predictions, it focuses on interpretation —
helping you understand why certain patterns, questions, or tensions may be present right now.
    `
  },
  
  integration: {
  default: `
When a life phase and cycle intersect, the experience is shaped by both broader context and immediate timing.
Rather than indicating a fixed outcome, this combination highlights what may be most useful to focus on now.

A helpful way to use this reading is to treat it as a “lens”:
not a conclusion, but a way to notice what you might otherwise miss.
If you reread it later, you may recognize different details — because you will be in a slightly different state.

Clarity often emerges through attention and reflection, not force.
