  phase: {
    foundation: `
The Foundation Phase emphasizes stability, grounding, and the creation of reliable structures.
This phase often appears when life is asking for consistency rather than speed.

People in this phase may feel a pull toward order, routine, or reassessing what truly supports them.
Rather than limiting growth, this phase provides the base that allows future movement to be sustainable.
    `,

    transition: `
The Transition Phase emerges when existing roles, habits, or directions no longer feel fully aligned.
It is characterized by uncertainty, questioning, and heightened awareness.

This phase is not a mistake or failure.
It is often a necessary period of reorientation before meaningful change becomes visible.
    `,

    expansion: `
The Expansion Phase reflects outward movement, increased engagement, and the desire to explore new possibilities.
Energy during this phase often feels more available, expressive, and future-oriented.

While expansion can feel exciting, it also requires discernment to avoid overextension.
    `,

    consolidation: `
The Consolidation Phase focuses on integration, refinement, and strengthening what has already been built.
It often follows periods of growth or experimentation.

This phase supports maturity, coherence, and long-term sustainability rather than rapid change.
    `,

    reflection: `
The Reflection Phase centers on review, meaning-making, and internal alignment.
It often arises when external progress slows, inviting deeper understanding.

Rather than being passive, this phase allows insight to surface that may not be accessible during action-oriented periods.

  cycle: {
    beginning: `
The Beginning Cycle represents early movement and emerging awareness.
It is a stage where direction starts to form, but outcomes remain undefined.

This cycle favors curiosity, small steps, and openness over immediate certainty.
    `,

    acceleration: `
The Acceleration Cycle is marked by increasing momentum and engagement.
Actions taken during this cycle tend to build upon one another more quickly.

Attention to pacing becomes important to maintain balance.
    `,

    peak: `
The Peak Cycle reflects intensity, visibility, and heightened impact.
Efforts often reach their most active or demanding point during this stage.

Clarity and responsibility are especially important here.
    `,

    adjustment: `
The Adjustment Cycle emphasizes recalibration and fine-tuning.
It often follows periods of intensity, asking for course correction rather than abandonment.

Small changes during this cycle can significantly affect long-term outcomes.
    `,

    closure: `
The Closure Cycle involves completion, release, and transition away from what has run its course.
It allows space for lessons to integrate before the next beginning.

Closure does not imply loss; it creates capacity.

  integration: {
    default: `
When a life phase and cycle intersect, the experience is shaped by both broader context and immediate timing.
Rather than indicating a fixed outcome, this combination highlights what may be most useful to focus on now.

Clarity often emerges through attention and reflection, not force.
