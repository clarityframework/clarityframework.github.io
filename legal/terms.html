      <h2>1) Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Clarity Framework provides a self-reflection digital product that delivers a personalized
        reading page after purchase. This product is not medical, legal, financial, or professional advice.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your location) to purchase.</p>

      <h2>3) Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not attempt to reverse engineer, scrape, or abuse the service.</li>
        <li>Do not use the product for harassment, deception, or unlawful activity.</li>
        <li>Do not resell or redistribute access to the reading pages or text content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Delivery & Access</h2>
      <p>
        Access is delivered via the post-purchase confirmation and email receipt button.
        Once your reading opens, you are responsible for bookmarking that page for future access.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Private browsing modes and aggressive privacy extensions may prevent access by blocking storage or redirect data.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All content, text, and branding are owned by Clarity Framework and protected by applicable laws.
        Purchase grants a personal, non-transferable license to use the reading for your own reflection.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The product is a reflective tool only. It does not predict outcomes and does not replace professional advice.
        You are solely responsible for your decisions and actions.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Clarity Framework is not liable for indirect, incidental,
        consequential, or special damages arising from your use of the product.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>
