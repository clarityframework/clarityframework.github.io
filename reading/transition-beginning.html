      <h1>Hello <span id="username"></span>,</h1>

      <p>
        Based on your responses, this reading reflects the
        <strong>Transition</strong> phase combined with the
        <strong>Beginning</strong> cycle.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Current Phase: Transition</h2>
      <p>
        You are currently in the Transition Phase.
        This phase often arises when something no longer fits,
        but the next direction is not yet fully clear.
        It can feel uncertain, restless, or mentally busy.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Current Cycle: Beginning</h2>
      <p>
        You are currently in a Beginning cycle within this phase.
        This cycle often marks the early stages of a shift —
        when awareness starts to form,
        but outcomes are not yet defined.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Combination Suggests</h2>
      <p>
        When this phase and cycle combine, it often suggests a period where
        internal awareness is more important than immediate action.
        This is a time for noticing patterns,
        rather than trying to force certainty too quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection Points</h2>
      <p>
        • What part of my life feels “no longer fitting,” even if I can’t fully explain why?<br>
        • Where am I trying to force certainty too quickly?<br>
        • What would a small, low-risk step toward clarity look like?
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Note: This reading is a reflective tool only. It does not predict outcomes
        or replace professional advice. All decisions remain your responsibility.
