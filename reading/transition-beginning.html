      <h1>Hello <span id="username"></span>,</h1>

      <p>
        Based on your responses, this reading reflects a period of transition
        combined with the early stage of a new cycle.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Current Phase: Transition</h2>
      <p>
        Transition phases often emerge when previous structures or roles
        no longer feel fully aligned, even if the next direction is not yet clear.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Current Cycle: Beginning</h2>
      <p>
        The beginning cycle emphasizes emergence, exploration, and gentle movement
        rather than immediate certainty or commitment.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Combination Suggests</h2>
      <p>
        When transition and beginning overlap, it can be useful to prioritize
        awareness over action. This is a time for noticing patterns,
        signals, and internal responses before making major decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection Points</h2>
      <p>
        • What feels outdated or misaligned right now?<br>
        • Where might small experiments feel safer than large commitments?<br>
        • What signals are you currently overlooking?
      </p>

        or replace professional advice. All decisions remain your responsibility.
